# Bug Tracker App

## Objective:
This app was created to allow people to report their bugs and for others to help, eventually leading to a resolved issue.

This app is still a work in progress. Future plans:
- Adding teams
    - Bugs can be reported to your team and can only be visible to them
    - You can get invited to a team and also leave a team
    - Only an admin can invite a person
